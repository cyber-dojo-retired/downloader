The initial file-structure for this repo was copied from creator
with additional files from differ.


When git is actually being used in v2 then the directory structure 
will need to be something like this:
	/sandbox/*
	  - will hold all the text files the user sees in the browser.
	    These are the files sent to runner and saved in runner's /sandbox dir.
	/config/*
	  - will hold the manifest.json file which never changes
	    together with the files holding the state of the options
		eg is prediction on/off, is theme light/dark
	/events.json    
	    This will be appended to for each test run
	/event.json     
	    This will be the (current) individual test run info.

Each test submission will need to
o) delete everything in sandbox/
o) save incoming files in sandbox/
o) append to events.json
o) replace event.json
o) do a git commit and git tag

Each option change, eg prediction on -> off will need to
o) process its file in config/ as per normal
o) do a git commit and git tag ????? 


- How will model implement its v2 ?
  It will still need to delegate to saver.
  So saver will need a 'batch' API 
  I think I will still need the kata_event(id, index) functionality.
  Eg for progress? on the dashboard.
  use [git archive] and [git ls-tree]

- TODOS
  1. Add model's API to saver.
  2. All clients can now call saver rather than model (one less network hop)
  3. Model can delegate to saver.
  4. Saver renamed to model.
  -
  A. Decouple dashboard from saver so it uses only model?
  -
    i. Add v2 storage to saver that stores directly in git format.
   ii. Add kata_git_diff() to saver and use in differ service.
       It can do git diff directly      
  iii. Add kata_git_repo_tgz() to saver and offer download option in UI
       It can do tar directly
   iv. Refactor kata_event(id, index)
       It can use [git archive] to get tar file, pipe to untar, into /tmp
	   To get names of files use [git ls-tree -r TAG]
	   Then recreate the json response.

- Don't offer download_group()
  Instead, from a group allow selection of avatar from 8x8 grid (similar to joining)

- Q96 test runs in ~0.3s
  This shows that generating the git repo on-the-fly is not feasible. Too slow.
  I need to extend model with v2 that saves directly in git format.
  Then model can expose two new API methods
     kata_git_repo_tgz(id)
	   This is stateless. Just create a tgz file in /tmp
	   It can only be offered (from UI) for version 2 katas initially.
	   Later I can provide a migration for v0,v1 repos. 
	   Migration will need to set dates in the past for git commits.
	   See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3895453/how-do-i-make-a-git-commit-in-the-past
	   Env vars GIT_AUTHOR_DATE GIT_COMMITTER_DATE
	   
  	 kata_git_diff(id, was_index, now_index)
	   This can be stateless too.
	   I just need to use the same trick as differ, get massive context around
	   the diffs so you get the entire files. Don't process the [git diff]
	   output in model at all. Let the differ service do that.
    
- This might change the model API slightly.
  Currently it offers...
    kata_events(id)
	   This will still be needed for dashboard and web.
	   So /events.json will still need to be saved as meta data
	   Confirms that a /sandbox dir for the users files.
	kata_event(id, index)	
	   I don't think this will be needed.
	   Diff-summary can come from differ service which can use kata_git_diff().	   	   
	
- However, this repo could still be useful for simple client-side proof of concept.

- Currently not running branch-coverage.
  See test/coverage.rb
  SimpleCov.start do
    #enable_coverage :branch
    ...
  end
 
- Do I want to save the manifest in the tgz?
  I think yes.
  It is needed if you want to create a start-point for example.

- tgz filename needs to include the exercise (if there is one)

- What should the directory be called?
   individual: cyber-dojo-2021-03-14-DfH8sP-FizzBuzz
   from-group: cyber-dojo-2021-03-14-SS67eJ-lion-FizzBuzz
                
- How to provide instructions on pushing the repo to a remote, eg github?
  $ git remote add origin git@github.com:user/repo.git
  $ git push origin main
