The initial file-structure for this repo was copied from creator
with additional files from differ.

Don't offer download_group()
Instead, from a group allow selection of avatar from 8x8 grid (similar to joining)

The .tgz file when unzipped will produce a directory with a git repo in it.

- Currently getting coverage of all files.
  Need to drop /usr/... files being covered
  This should speed up that step a lot
  
- Currently not running branch-coverage.
  See test/coverage.rb
  SimpleCov.start do
    #enable_coverage :branch
    ...
  end
 
- Do I want to save the manifest in the tgz?
  I think yes.
  It is needed if you want to create a start-point for example.

- tgz filename needs to include the exercise (if there is one)

- What should the directory be called?
   individual: cyber-dojo-2021-03-14-DfH8sP-FizzBuzz
   from-group: cyber-dojo-2021-03-14-SS67eJ-lion-FizzBuzz
                
- How to provide instructions on pushing the repo to a remote, eg github?
  $ git remote add origin git@github.com:user/repo.git
  $ git push origin main
