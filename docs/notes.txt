The initial file-structure for this repo were copied from creator.

The .tgz file when unzipped will produce a directory with a git repo in it.

- What should the directory be called?
   individual: cyber-dojo-2021-03-14-DfH8sP-FizzBuzz
        group: cyber-dojo-2021-03-14-SS67eJ-FizzBuzz
        
- How to provide instructions on pushing the repo to a remote, eg github?
  $ git remote add origin git@github.com:user/repo.git
  $ git push push origin main
  
- What are the branch names for download_group()?
     individual-id + group-name 
   eg   
   - Es72La-alligator
   - 886Ww4-gorilla
   - etc
   
- I cannot use simple integer tags for each traffic-light
  since tags have to be unique at the repo level not the branch level.
  So drop tags until they prove useful in some way.
